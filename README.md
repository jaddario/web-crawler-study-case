## Overview
A group of friends decided to make their lives easier when it comes to buying women's clothing. They noticed that it was very difficult to compare the prices of plus-size clothes. They decided to hire a developer (YOU) to create an application that would allow them to compare the prices of plus-size clothing on various websites

## Requirements
- Scraping from at least 3 different websites.
- Do not use sites that already perform this comparison (e.g., Buscap√©, ...)
- The user input into the system will be a clothing category (e.g., T-shirt, pants, jacket, blouse, ...)
- The system should return a paginated list (3 items per page), sorted by descending price.
- Each item should include:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Price
    - Link to the item on the website
    - Image (one is sufficient)
    - Category (one is sufficient)
    - Sizes (e.g., [XXL, XL, L])
